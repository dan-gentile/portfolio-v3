### General info

A portfolio page should best reflect the creator. For me the last 10 years of my life have revolved around live events.
Throughout that time responsibilities have grown and evolved. The last few years it has been mostly focused on video whether that be creation, programming systems or playback.
Recent projects have involved projection mapping or pixel mapping to complex and simple shapes. During the process 3D models are crucial so I thought it would be fun to include some
here in the site.

Whether its the past, present or future. Bringing ideas to reality are the creative challenges I strive for, and this sure was a challenge.
